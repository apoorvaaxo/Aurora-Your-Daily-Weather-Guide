- **Dynamic UI**: Adjusts the background and icons based on the current weather conditions.

## User Interface

   - **Search Bar**: Allows users to enter a city name and search for weather data.

2. **Background Layout**:
   - **Dynamic Background Image**: Changes based on current weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy).

3. **Main Content**:
   - **WeatherCard**: Shows current weather information including icon, temperature, location, wind speed, humidity, heat index, and conditions. Styled with a modern glassmorphism effect.
   - **MiniCard**: Provides a small forecast with an icon, temperature, and time. Uses a glassmorphism style for a consistent look.
